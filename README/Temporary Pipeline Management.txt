Temporary Pipeline Management:
* Stage 1 (Data Read/Write without priority):
   -> Upper Clock Cycle:
       - Fetch Stage Disable (Will be done on the falling edge)
       - Instruction Pointer Disable
       - Data Stack Push (Will be done on the falling edge)
       - Register Bus & Data Bus Connect
       - Bus Interface Unit Read
       - Register Read
       - Index Register Decrement
       - Flag Register Handling
       - TemporaryARegister Fetch
       - Address Calculation (Segment * 8 + Base + Index * Scale + Displacement)
   -> Lower Clock Cycle:
       - Bus Interface Unit Write
       - Register Write 
       - Fetch Instruction (if FSD is off)
       - TemporaryDRegister Fetch
       - Index Register Increment
       - TemporaryARegister Increment
* Stage 2 (Data Read/Write with priority):
   -> Upper Clock Cycle:
       - Fetch Stage Disable (Will be done on the falling edge)
       - Instruction Pointer Disable
       - Data Stack Push (Will be done on the falling edge)
       - Register Bus & Data Bus Connect
       - Bus Interface Unit Read
       - Register Read
       - Index Register Decrement
       - Address Calculation (Segment * 8 + Base + Index * Scale + Displacement)
   -> Lower Clock Cycle:
       - Bus Interface Unit Write
       - Register Write 
       - TemporaryDRegister Fetch
       - Index Register Increment
       - TemporaryARegister Reset to 0
* Stage 3 (ALU & Register-to-Register):
   -> Upper Clock Cycle:
       - Register Read
       - LHS & RHS Register Read
       - ALU Execute
   -> Lower Clock Cycle:
       - Register Write
